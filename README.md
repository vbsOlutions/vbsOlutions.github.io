SOLVE IT QUICK AND SCALABLE BY VBSCRIPT

Will VBScript fade away, leaving us back with PowerShell lego? (i.e. those big [DUPLO](http://www.lego.com/en-us/duplo) ones)

The older ones among us (which may be those using VBScript) may remember the death of JavaScript around the rise of the new millenium ... so let's see what may happen to vbs (Imagine people coming to conclude that it would be nice to be able to scale things DOWN, meaning really DOWN to very individual needs, and managing that very quickly).

*solve IT ...*
